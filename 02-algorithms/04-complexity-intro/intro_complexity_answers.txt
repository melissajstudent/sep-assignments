Describe an analogy for relating an algorithm that has efficiency O(1) and another algorithm that has O(2n).
An algorithm that has O(1) is a  train and an algorithm that has O(2n) is a person walking.

In plain English, what is the best case scenario for binary search?
The best case scenario for binary search is the element to be found is in the middle of the set of searched items.

In plain English, what is the worst-case scenario for binary search?
The worst case scenario is the element to be found is either in second position or exactly before the end of the set of searched items.

In plain English, what is the bounded-case scenario for binary search?
The bounded-case scenario in a binary search is when the item to be found is in the 3rd position through n-2 position (n representing the size of the collection).

Infinity

What is the Big-O of an algorithm that has the data points above?
O(2^n)

Write a Ruby script that calculates and prints the N number, given an iteration, for linear search in the worst case (similar to the graph above).

Create a graph from the output using Google Sheets or other graphing software. Analyze the graph and denote its Big-O somewhere on the graph.
